* elementary implementation of S3 constructor has been completed

* need to think more carefully about how best to perform computations and add
    quantities of interest to the S3 object and/or how to perform operations on
    the object after passing inputs to the constructor

* while the addition of generic methods looks correct, a lot of work is going to
    need to go in to making sure everything works together -- consider using
    the SuperLearner package as an example
