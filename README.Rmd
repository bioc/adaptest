> Data-adaptive statistics for multiple testing in high-dimensional problems

__Authors:__ Wilson Cai and [Nima Hejazi](http://nimahejazi.org)

## What's `adaptest`?

The `adaptest` R package is a tool for performing multiple testing on effect
sizes under high-dimensional settings, using the approach of data-adaptive
statistical target parameters and inference. For technical details on the
data-adaptive multiple testing procedure, consult @cai2018data. For an
introduction to statistical inference procedures using data-adaptive target
parameters, the interested reader is directed to @hubbard2016statistical.

## Installation

<!--
For standard use, install from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org):
```{r bioc-installation, eval = FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("adaptest")
```
-->

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wilsoncai1992/adaptest")
```

## Contributions

It is our hope that `adaptest` will grow to be widely adopted as a tool for
employing data-adaptive multiple hypothesis testing procedures in
high-dimensional and complex problem settings. To that end, contributions are
very welcome, though we ask that interested contributors consult our
[`contribution
guidelines`](https://github.com/wilsoncai1992/adaptest/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
prior to submitting a pull request.
