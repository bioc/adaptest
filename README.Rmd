> Data-adaptive statistics for multiple testing in high-dimensional biology

__Authors:__ [Wilson Cai](https://stat.berkeley.edu/~wcai) and [Nima

## What's `adaptest`?

The `adaptest` R package is a tool for performing multiple testing on effect
sizes in high-dimensional settings, using the approach of data-adaptive
statistical target parameters and inference. For technical details on the
data-adaptive multiple testing procedure, consult @cai2018data. For an
introduction to statistical inference procedures using data-adaptive target
parameters, the interested reader is directed to @hubbard2016statistical.

## Installation

For standard use, install from
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/adaptest) using
[`BiocManager`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager):
```{r bioc-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("adaptest")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ (i.e., branch __`master`__)
from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wilsoncai1992/adaptest")
```

Current and prior [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) releases are
available under branches with numbers prefixed by "RELEASE_". For example, to
install the version of this package available via Bioconductor 3.7, use

```{r gh-develop-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wilsoncai1992/adaptest", ref = "RELEASE_3_7")
```

**_Note_: As the first stable release of this package was through Bioconductor
v3.7, the minimum version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) required to
install `adaptest` is 3.5.0 (codename "Joy in Playing").**
