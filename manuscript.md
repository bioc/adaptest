# Summary

This package contains an implementation of the data-adaptive statistical
approach to estimating effect sizes in high-dimensional settings while avoiding
many of the pitfalls common to multiple testing. Implementation...

The use of data-adaptive statistics is an emerging approach...

The tools provided in this package are intended for use in high-dimensional settings, in particular with data generated by genomics experiments...
